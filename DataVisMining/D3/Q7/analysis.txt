1. Ease to develop
        Tableau: Not easy to integrate app-development on top, not build for developer. 
        D3: time comsuming at development phase, but worth the cost for productionalizing app-like reporting suite.
        Python: an open community for developers with very high flexibility. Good choice for developing research code.
2. Ease to maintain 
        Python: high maintainence cost, free software fees
        Tableau: easier to maintain, but high software fees
        D3: high maintainence cost, but free software fees
3. Usability of visualization: 
		Tableau: easily merge multiple types of datafiles. Easy to visualize. Not easy to deal with nested data sources, NoSQL databases, web scraping, and anything requested via http
		D3: Very large library of visualizations, fast and flawless integration into websites
		Python: not as easy as the other two to quickly get a very nice plot with lots of customization. Better at dealing with data scraping and database manipulation
4. Scalability
		Tableau: good for tuned database for sub-second query response times. The data size it can analyse is constrained by the capacity of the database.
		D3: DOM manipulations of large data can be very slow. Layout algorithms, particularly some force layout algorithms, are very heavy to run.
		Python: python itself is light weight. By using python with distributed framework such as Hadoop can efficiently scale.  
4. System requirement
		Tableau: Supported OSs include Windows 7+, OSX 10.10+, Unix/Linux, etc
		D3: Open source. Supported browsers include Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Opera and IE9
		Python: Open source. Supported OSs include Windows, OSX, Unix/Linux,
